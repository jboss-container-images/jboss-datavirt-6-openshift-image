    - name: JAVA_MAX_MEM_RATIO
      description: This is used to calculate a default maximal heap memory based on a containers restriction. If used in a container without any memory constraints for the container then this option has no effect. If there is a memory constraint then `-Xmx` is set to a ratio of the container available memory as set here. The default is `50` which means 50% of the available memory is used as an upper boundary. You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0` in which case no `-Xmx` option is added.
      example: "50"
    - name: JAVA_INITIAL_MEM_RATIO
      description: This is used to calculate a default initial heap memory based the maximumal heap memory.  The default is `100` which means 100% of the maximal heap is used for the initial heap size.  You can skip this mechanism by setting this value to `0` in which case no `-Xms` option is added.
      example: "100"
    - name: JAVA_MAX_INITIAL_MEM
      description: The maximum size of the initial heap memory, if the calculated default initial heap is larger then it will be capped at this value.  The default is 4096 MB.
      example: "4096"
    - name: JAVA_CORE_LIMIT
      description: Core limit as described in https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/scheduler/sched-bwc.txt.  Used to configure the number of GC threads and parallelism for ForkJoinPool.  Defaults to container core limit.
      example: "2"
    - name: JAVA_DIAGNOSTICS
